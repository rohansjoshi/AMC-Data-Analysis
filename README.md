# AMC-Data-Analysis

Had some fun exploring the datasets of USAMO qualifiers and AMC Honor Roll winners with Pandas and Matplotlib. I used Plotly to create chloropleth maps illustrating the geographic distribution of honor rollees. To create a more detailed map by county, I used the Google Maps API to find which county each school is in, and I plotted county data using the system of FIPS county codes.
